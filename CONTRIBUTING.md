# Contributing to CAVRO

All development of cavro is tracked on github.  Please feel free to contribute, either by raising an issue, or proposing a change with a PR.

Every contribution is valued and should be treated with the utmost respect.
While some changes may require adjustments before being integrated, it's important to remember that collaboration is at the heart of keeping cavro great.
Let's work together to maintain the excellence of our project.

## :bug: Raising a bug

If you think you've found a bug, please raise an issue.  The best issues contain:

1. A description of your environment (Python versions, cavro versions, OS, any other useful info)
2. A description of how to trigger the bug (ideally with a code example)
3. What you expected to happen
4. What actually happens for you
5. Any other useful information

Please keep in mind that cavro is a publically accessible project. Your code, logs and data may be private to you or your employer, so be careful before sharing information on issues.


## ðŸ©¹ Fixing bugs

Anyone may raise a pull request that fixes a bug.  The diff will be reviewed before approving.

Please reference bug #numbers in any related PR.

Typically, a bug fix will include a test that showcases the behaviour in the bug report, allowing us to show the issue is resolved.

## ðŸ†• Adding Features & Functionality

We warmly welcome feature requests and suggestions.  Different ideas help to keep cavro excellent, and diversify the libraries strengths.

If you have an idea for anything that `cavro` could do differently or better, please raise an issue to describe/discuss it.
Ideally before spending too much time on implementation. This allows people involved on the project to discuss and agree on the 
right approach that fits in with how `cavro` works before.

It may be that a proposal is ultimately not implemented, or implemented in a different way to the original proposal.

If you have a code change that you'd like to share, or request, please submit a pull request.


# ðŸ“– Documentation, tests, and dev guides (like this one)

The documentation for cavro is an ever-evolving work in progress.

While the basics are covered, there's always room for improvement.

We warmly welcome and greatly appreciate any contributions to enhance user documentation, testing or dev documentation
